    "The app simply-flash-cards can be used to study and memorize an area of choice. It has a few modes called study, memorize, test, multi-choice and text. For example in study mode all cards are displayed and everything on each card is visible, making it easy for you to read through the material. Memorize mode means all cards are displayed and the title of each card is visible, click the card to flip it and reveal/hide the answer. This makes it easy to go back and forth and memorize the information.",
